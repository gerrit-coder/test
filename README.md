This directory contains test environments and setup scripts for the Gerrit Coder Workspace integration. It includes both the Gerrit server setup and the Coder workspace configuration.

## 📋 Overview

The test directory is organized into two main components:

1. **`gerrit/`** - Docker-based setup for building and deploying Gerrit v3.4.1 from source
2. **`coder/`** - Test environment for the Coder Workspace Gerrit plugin with Terraform-based workspace management
